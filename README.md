# Housing Value Prediction using Machine Learning
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to predict housing values using various machine learning regression models. The goal is to train, evaluate, and compare the performance of three different algorithms on a real-world housing dataset to determine the most effective predictor.

## Models Compared
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Random Forest Regressor

## Dataset
The housing.csv dataset is included in this repository. It contains features such as median income, housing age, and location to predict the median house value.

## Project Workflow
The process involves a standard machine learning pipeline:

- Data Cleaning: Loading the dataset and handling missing values through imputation.
- Feature Scaling: Normalizing numerical features to ensure fair model training.
- Model Training: Training each of the three models on the prepared dataset.
- Evaluation: Comparing the models' performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
